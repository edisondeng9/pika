      <article class="main"><p>There are more than tons of thousand methods of stock picking but it all come down to TWO basic analyses: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis [FA] is a way trying to understand better the companies and their business models. We want to look at its business fundamentals such as the financial ratios. We also want to measure its business based on its past, current and future performance. This can be done by looking at their financial statements. Hence, by doing so, we can derive the stock&rsquo;s intrinsic value. By understanding the business models, we get a picture of source of revenue, customer base, products and services being offered and reason for buying them. And by understanding the management, we will know how the company runs its business and its strategies or goals they have for the company. By having a grip yet solid understanding, a temporary drop in the stock prices won&rsquo;t affect us as we are confident that the company will overcome the hurdles and do well in the long run.</p>
<p>The trend is your friend. By doing technical analysis [TA], we are forecasting the direction of stock prices through the study of past trends and patterns. This is mainly done by analyzing the past prices and volume of the stock. It is said that the past trends are bound to happen again, hence by studying these trends we might be able to predict the future. One of the basic foundation is reading the candle stick chart. A candlestick shows the opening and closing price of a stock as well as highs and lows for a specific period of time. Green candlestick means closing price higher than the opening and red candlestick vice versa. There are 6 type of bullish candlestick patterns but it is far more better to understand the concept behind it. Green candlestick means high demand; more buyers than sellers and pushes price up; conversely for the red candlestick. Why do we use candlestick chart? This provides a better view of what happening for the stock during the specific period, interaction between buyers and sellers and understand the market sentiment.</p>
<p>So when do we use them? It all comes down t your time horizon. How long do you intend to hold the stocks for? Let use buying a house as an example.</p>
<p>FA: If we buy the house with the intention to sell it in 10 years later, we are going to look at its infrastructure, the development or if there&rsquo;s any upcoming construction in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>TA: However, if we but the house only with intention to flip it and sell it the next week, all the above mentioned criterion won&rsquo;t matter much. Instead we want to know about the prices of the house being sold in the neighborhood or if there&rsquo;s any volume in the number of houses sold.</p>
<p>Both analysis are good in their respective ways. But in order to gain an edge, we have to use both so that we can make better informed decision to maximize our returns.</p>
<p>So, what is the best time to invest? the truth is there isn&rsquo;t a best time to buy stocks, as the market is volatile and irrational, the prices can fall 10% this week and rise 20% next week. Finding the best time require lot practise and effort and you will never be 100% correct. The best way will be using dollar-averaging-cost. Rather than buying $10,000 at one go, instead dollar average it by $2,000 over the period of 5 times. This spread the risk rather than trying to time the market.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
